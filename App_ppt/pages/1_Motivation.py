    - Rapid progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other generative models has led to the creation of highly realistic and convincing synthetic face images.
    - These models can generate faces with intricate details, realistic expressions, and diverse characteristics, making it challenging for human eyes to discern the authenticity.
    - The use of Generative AI for creating fake faces raises ethical concerns, including the potential for misuse, privacy infringements, and the creation of misleading content.
    - No established state-of-the-art research papers on real and fake face classification exist.
    - Developing our own models by integrating insights from existing research.
    - Focused on overcoming the difficulties posed by advanced Generative AI in creating nearly indistinguishable fake faces.
